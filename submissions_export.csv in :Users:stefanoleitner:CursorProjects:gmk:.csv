- If the hematocrit rises above the upper limit of normal, the dose of testosterone should be reduced or discontinued, and the hematocrit should be rechecked two months after the change [1]. If the hematocrit normalizes, a lower dose of testosterone may be resumed [1].

- These redirect to 'erythrocytosis',  not 'monitoring'. Both are found on the same page.

- Erythrocytosis is more frequently observed with injectable testosterone preparations compared to transdermal gels [1][2]
- Citation [2] does not mention the co-relation between erythrocytosis and injections/ gels.
